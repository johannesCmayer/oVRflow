oVRflow is a VR dance game that makes use of HTC Vive Trackers to track your hands and feet. Move your body to the pounding beats of an interactive music track and keep up your flow as long as possible. Hit boxes with the correct bodyparts and avoid follower-objects through dance. More than 60 phases with different gameplay elements keep the dance interesting and make for a new experience every time.
